# Private-Use-Solar-Energy-Potential-in-California-
A brief study on how much of California's energy needs could be met by using privately owned sunroof solar panels and what is required to construct such an infrastructure. 

The study details the work done by Google on their latest project: Project Sunroof. 
Project Sunroof is an initiative that primarily works to encourage the private adoption of solar energy by providing a set of tools to facilitate the purchase and installation of solar panels. 
It is a software that works by calculating potential solar savings based on roof shape and local weather patterns by utilizing machine learning and 3D models within Google Earth images.

The topic of this notebook encompasses the capabilities of Project Sunroof as well as the potential for the adoption of the Renewable energy mentioned above in the state of California, USA.
Exploration on the dataset includes details such as:
- Solar Panel Coverage on Buildings in the state of California (per Postal Code)
- Potential Numbers of Solar Panel to be Installed on California's Buildings (per Postal Code)
- Potential Solar Power Generation Numbers in California (in kWh / Year per Postal Code)
- Potential Solar Power Generation Numbers in California vs Arizona
- Number of Buildings Estimated to have a Solar Installation in California
- Total Potential Numbers of Solar Panel to be Installed on California vs Neighbouring States
- Total Potential Solar Power Generation Numbers in California vs Neighbouring States

Libraries used: Pandas, Matplotlib, Scipy, Numpy, Seaborn, Statistics

A Tableau dashboard is also provided covering the points above.
